# Service Task â€“ Full Stack Application

This repository contains a full stack service management system, composed of:

- [`service-manager`](./service-manager): Angular frontend application
- [`services`](./services): Spring Boot backend API with MongoDB

Both services are fully containerized with Docker and can be run locally using Docker Compose.
